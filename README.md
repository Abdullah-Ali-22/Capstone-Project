Project Overview

In this project I developed a XGBoost model in SageMaker to predict the distance between the projectile when it hit the ground and the catapult depending on several inputs which are release angle, firing angle, cup elevation, pin elevation, and bungee position.

Datasets

For this project, the input data is collected from an online simulator of a catapult by changing. Link for the simulator is provided in the last page of the report. By changing the five inputs of the experiment (release angle, firing angle, cup elevation, pin elevation, and bungee position)
